# Overconfidence Prevention Extension

When this extension is loaded (recommended for all features), agents resist the systematic tendency to skip questions, make assumptions, and proceed with incomplete information.

## Why This Exists

LLM agents exhibit overconfidence: they skip clarifying questions, assume requirements that weren't stated, and proceed with incomplete information rather than asking for what they need. In an autonomous pipeline, there's no human to catch these assumptions at approval gates — quality gates must catch them instead.

This extension adapts AIDLC's overconfidence prevention for autonomous agents. Instead of "ask the user," the pattern is "document the assumption and make the conservative choice."

## The Five Overconfidence Patterns

### Pattern 1: Skipping Exploration

**What happens**: Agent receives a spec and immediately starts planning/implementation without exploring edge cases.

**Example**: Spec says "list features." Agent builds a simple list endpoint. Spec didn't mention pagination, filtering, or sorting — but a real feature list needs them.

**Prevention**: Before planning, explicitly enumerate:
- Empty state behavior (what if there are zero features?)
- Large result sets (pagination needed?)
- Filtering and sorting requirements
- Error responses (what if the database is down?)
- Concurrent access (what if two users modify the same feature?)

Write these as explicit assumptions in the spec/plan: `[ASSUMPTION: no pagination needed for MVP]`

### Pattern 2: Assuming Happy Path Only

**What happens**: Agent implements the success path and skips error handling, edge cases, and failure modes.

**Example**: Agent builds a POST endpoint that works when all fields are present and valid. But doesn't handle missing fields, invalid types, empty strings, or conflicting resources.

**Prevention**: For every feature, explicitly define:
- 400: What input validation errors can occur?
- 404: What resources might not exist?
- 409: What conflicts can happen?
- 500: What internal failures can happen?
- Empty state: What does the response look like when there's nothing to return?

The PM's acceptance criteria must cover these. The Architect's done conditions must test these. The Developer must implement these. The Tester must verify these.

### Pattern 3: Vague Acceptance Criteria

**What happens**: PM writes "should work well" or "should be fast" or "should handle errors" instead of testable criteria.

**Prevention**: Every acceptance criterion must follow this format:
```
AC-001: Given [specific precondition], when [specific action], then [specific expected result]
  Test level: [smoke | integration | e2e | unit]
  Verification: [specific assertion or scenario]
```

Banned phrases in acceptance criteria:
- "should work well" → replace with specific expected behavior
- "should be fast" → replace with specific latency target
- "should handle errors" → replace with specific error codes and responses
- "should be intuitive" → replace with specific user interactions
- "should be robust" → replace with specific failure scenarios handled

### Pattern 4: Unjustified Scope Expansion

**What happens**: Agent adds "nice to have" features, over-engineers, or implements more than the spec requires.

**Example**: Spec says "add an API endpoint." Agent adds the endpoint, plus a file watcher, an SSE registry, an acceptance test generator, and a web UI framework. (This actually happened.)

**Prevention**: Before implementing, enumerate exactly what the task requires:
1. Read the task's done conditions
2. List only what's needed to satisfy those conditions
3. Check each piece of implementation: "Is this needed to satisfy a done condition?"
4. If the answer is no, don't implement it

The Architect's done conditions must be specific enough to prevent scope expansion. "Implement the API" is not a done condition. "Implement the API and verify: service starts, GET /api/features returns 200, POST /api/features with missing title returns 400" is.

### Pattern 5: Claiming Without Evidence

**What happens**: Agent says "tests pass" without specifying which tests, "the service works" without running it, or "all acceptance criteria met" without quoting evidence.

**Prevention**: Every claim must be backed by specific evidence:
- "Tests pass" → "TestSmokeServerStartsAndResponds, TestSmokeRecoveryNoNilPointer, TestIntegrationJSONArraysNeverNull all pass"
- "The service works" → "I started the server on :8765 and hit every endpoint: GET /api/features returns 200, POST /api/features returns 201, GET /api/features/123 returns 404"
- "All acceptance criteria met" → "AC-001: MET — GET /api/features returns 200 with empty array (verified in server_test.go:45). AC-002: MET — POST /api/features with valid input returns 201 (verified in server_test.go:78)"

This is the "proof of work, not claims" principle already in the testing rules. Overconfidence prevention extends it to every phase.

## Phase-Specific Overconfidence Checks

### Inception (PM)
- [ ] Have I asked about every ambiguous term in the request?
- [ ] Have I defined empty state behavior for every collection/list?
- [ ] Have I defined error responses for every endpoint?
- [ ] Are all acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format with test level?
- [ ] Have I marked every assumption as [ASSUMPTION: ...]?

### Planning (Architect)
- [ ] Does every task have done conditions with specific verifiable assertions?
- [ ] Does every component have a test strategy section?
- [ ] Have I identified agent failure mode checks for each task?
- [ ] Have I considered what happens when each external dependency fails?
- [ ] Is my implementation plan the minimum needed, or am I over-engineering?

### Construction (Developer)
- [ ] Have I verified the service starts without panicking?
- [ ] Have I hit every endpoint and checked the response?
- [ ] Have I tested error paths (400, 404, 409, 500)?
- [ ] Have I checked that JSON arrays are [] not null?
- [ ] Is my implementation the minimum needed to satisfy the done conditions?

### Review (Reviewer)
- [ ] For every "MET" claim, have I quoted specific code and line numbers?
- [ ] Have I checked for over-engineering (line count suspiciously high)?
- [ ] Have I verified error paths, not just happy paths?
- [ ] Have I checked nil pointer safety, not just "it compiles"?
- [ ] Have I verified null vs empty array serialization?

### Testing (Tester)
- [ ] Have I named specific files, methods, and assertions in my test report?
- [ ] Have I verified spec-implementation drift (comparing spec to what was built)?
- [ ] Have I tested error paths, not just happy paths?
- [ ] Have I checked for nil pointer panics in every handler?
- [ ] Is my test report reproducible (exact commands, exact assertions)?

## The Conservative Default

When uncertain, choose the more conservative option:
- Less scope over more scope
- Specific criteria over vague criteria
- Explicit error handling over assumed success
- Simpler implementation over clever implementation
- Fewer assumptions over more assumptions
- Documenting assumptions over hiding them
