# Feature Specification: Kanban View

**Feature Branch**: `kanban-view`

**Created**: 2026-06-22

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: Loose idea — "Add a Kanban board view to the Dev Team UI that shows features as cards organized by phase. Features displayed in columns (Inception, Planning, Construction, Review, Testing, Delivery). Cards show title, priority, status. Click card to navigate to detail page. Toggle between list view and Kanban board view."

> **Note on questions**: `questions.json` has been written with 8 clarifying questions. This spec is written with conservative `[ASSUMPTION:]` defaults so the inception gate can evaluate. If a human answers the questions, a subsequent PM run will reconcile any divergent answers.

## Workspace Summary (Brownfield)

**Repo**: `devteam` (single repo, primary checkout at `~/source/devteam`). Worktree at `~/source/devteam/worktrees/kanban-view/devteam` on branch `feature/kanban-view`.

**Stack**:
- Backend: Go (`cmd/devteam`, `internal/api`, `internal/feature`). HTTP API at `/api/*`.
- Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind v4, `@tanstack/react-query`, `react-router` v7. Located in `ui/`.
- E2E: Playwright at `ui/e2e/*.spec.ts`, runs on `:18765` (NOT `:8765` production).
- No drag-and-drop library installed. No CSS-in-JS. Tailwind utility classes only.

**Existing surface this feature touches**:
- `ui/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` — renders `FeatureList` when features exist, `EmptyState` when none, `IntakeForm` for creation. Uses `useQuery(['features'])` → `listFeatures()` returning `FeatureListResponse`.
- `ui/src/components/FeatureList.tsx` — sortable grid of `FeatureCard`. Sort fields: phase, priority, status, updated_at.
- `ui/src/components/FeatureCard.tsx` — `Link` to `/features/:id`; renders title, id, status badge, phase badge, priority badge, gate result indicator, pending-questions badge, updated date.
- `ui/src/types/index.ts` — `PHASES` (`['inception','planning','construction','review','testing','delivery']`), `PHASE_LABELS`, `STATUS_LABELS`, `PRIORITY_LABELS`, `FeatureSummary` interface.
- `ui/e2e/app.spec.ts` — existing tests assert `feature-card` testids, feature-count-badge, navigation to detail.

**Conventions**:
- Components use `data-testid` for E2E selectors.
- Tailwind dark-mode classes (`dark:...`) on every color.
- `useQuery`/`useMutation` from `@tanstack/react-query` for server state.
- No new runtime backend dependency required — `GET /api/features` already returns everything the board needs (current_phase, status, priority, gate_result, pending_questions_count, updated_at).

**Constitution compliance**: See end of spec.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Toggle Between List and Kanban Board (Priority: P1)

A user viewing the Dashboard can switch between the existing sortable list view and a new Kanban board view via a toggle control. The choice is remembered for the session. The list view continues to work unchanged when selected.

**Why this priority**: Without a toggle, the board either replaces the list (regression) or lives at a separate route the user has to find. The toggle is the minimum viable entry point and is independently testable: a user can flip the toggle and see two distinct layouts without any other feature.

**Independent Test**: Load the Dashboard, click the "Board" toggle, assert the Kanban columns render; click "List", assert the existing `FeatureList` renders. Both states render the same underlying feature data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** features exist and the Dashboard is loaded, **When** the user clicks the "Board" toggle, **Then** six phase columns render with feature cards placed in the column matching each feature's `current_phase`.
2. **Given** the board is visible, **When** the user clicks the "List" toggle, **Then** the existing `FeatureList` component renders with no Kanban columns present.
3. **Given** the Dashboard is loaded for the first time in a session, **When** no prior view choice is remembered, **Then** the List view is shown by default (conservative — preserves existing behavior; pending human answer on whether Board should be default).
4. **Given** the user has selected "Board", **When** they navigate away and return to the Dashboard within the same browser session, **Then** "Board" is still selected (persisted via sessionStorage).

---

### User Story 2 - Feature Cards on the Board Show Key State (Priority: P1)

On the Kanban board, each feature appears as a card in exactly one column — the column for its `current_phase`. The card shows the feature title, priority badge, status badge, pending-questions badge (when > 0), and gate result indicator for the current phase (when present). Clicking the card navigates to `/features/:id`, identical to the list view.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the board — visualizing features by phase. It is independently testable: a board with cards in the right columns and correct badges delivers value even without the toggle (US-1) being remembered across sessions.

**Independent Test**: Load the Board view, assert each feature's card lives in the column whose header equals `PHASE_LABELS[feature.current_phase]`, and the card's title/priority/status badges match the API response.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a feature with `current_phase='planning'`, `priority=1`, `status='in_progress'`, **When** the board renders, **Then** a card with the feature's title is present in the Planning column with a P1 badge and an "In Progress" status badge.
2. **Given** a feature with `pending_questions_count > 0`, **When** its card renders, **Then** the pending-questions badge is visible on the card.
3. **Given** a feature whose current-phase `gate_result` is present, **When** the card renders, **Then** a passed/failed gate indicator is visible.
4. **Given** a feature card on the board, **When** the user clicks the card, **Then** the browser navigates to `/features/:id` (same destination as the list view).
5. **Given** a feature whose `current_phase` is not one of the six known phases, **When** the board renders, **Then** the card is placed in a trailing "Other" column (defensive — should never happen in practice).

---

### User Story 3 - Empty Columns and Empty Board (Priority: P2)

When a phase has no features, its column still renders with a header and a muted "No features" placeholder. When the board itself has no features at all, the existing `EmptyState` component is shown instead of the board (and the view toggle is hidden).

**Why this priority**: Edge-case polish. Without it the board looks broken on small workspaces. Not required for MVP — the toggle and cards already deliver value.

**Independent Test**: Load the Board view in a workspace where some phases have no features; assert every phase column renders, empty columns show the placeholder.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no features exist with `current_phase='testing'`, **When** the board renders, **Then** the Testing column header is visible and its body contains a muted "No features" placeholder.
2. **Given** zero features exist in the workspace, **When** the Dashboard loads, **Then** the `EmptyState` component renders and the List/Board toggle is NOT visible.
3. **Given** zero features exist and the user previously selected "Board", **When** features are later created, **Then** the toggle becomes visible and the Board renders (state resumes).

---

### User Story 4 - Column Overflow Handling (Priority: P3)

When a column contains more cards than fit the viewport, the column scrolls vertically independent of other columns. The board's overall height is bounded to the viewport so column headers remain visible while bodies scroll.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have. Only matters on workspaces with many features in one phase. CSS `max-height` + `overflow-y-auto` is one line — included because it's cheap, but marked P3 because the absence doesn't break the feature.

**Independent Test**: Load the Board with a column containing 50+ cards; assert that column scrolls without dragging the page, and the column header stays visible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a column with more cards than fit the viewport height, **When** the user scrolls within that column, **Then** the column body scrolls while the column header and other columns remain fixed.
2. **Given** the board is rendered, **When** the viewport is resized shorter, **Then** each column's scroll area adjusts to the new viewport height.

### Edge Cases

- **Feature with unknown `current_phase` value**: Placed in a defensive trailing "Other" column. [ASSUMPTION: never expected in practice — backend enum is closed — but the UI must not crash.]
- **Feature with `status='cancelled'` or `'done'`**: Still appears in the column for its `current_phase`; status badge communicates the terminal state. [ASSUMPTION: cancelled/done features are NOT filtered out of the board — they remain visible for retrospective. Pending human answer on whether to dim/hide.]
- **Feature with `waiting_for_human` status**: Card is visually flagged (yellow ring / icon) so the user can spot features needing input. [ASSUMPTION: surface as a status badge color, no separate column.]
- **Feature with `gate_blocked` status**: Card is visually flagged (red ring / icon) in addition to the gate-result indicator.
- **API returns 200 with `features: []`**: Board does not render; `EmptyState` renders instead (per US-3).
- **API returns 500 / network error**: Existing `features-error` testid renders the error message; toggle is not visible (no data to show).
- **API returns `features` but `total_count` missing**: Defensive — derive count from `features.length`. [ASSUMPTION: existing Dashboard already handles this defensively per e2e test `feature count badge handles missing total_count`.]
- **User toggles to Board while data is loading**: Show the loading spinner in place of the board body (reuse existing `features-loading` testid pattern).
- **Dark mode**: All new elements include `dark:` Tailwind classes matching existing palette.
- **Drag-and-drop**: Out of scope (see Assumptions). The board is view-only.
- **Mobile/narrow viewport**: Board scrolls horizontally; columns have a fixed minimum width. [ASSUMPTION: min-width 240px per column, board uses `overflow-x-auto` on small screens.]
- **Feature with `status='draft'` and `current_phase='inception'`** (not yet started): [ASSUMPTION: appears in the Inception column. A separate "Backlog" column is NOT added — the input specifies exactly six phase columns. Pending human answer; if the human chooses a Backlog column, FR-001 and the column count change to seven.]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The Dashboard MUST provide a two-way toggle control ("List" / "Board") that switches the feature display between the existing `FeatureList` component and a new `KanbanBoard` component. Source: US-001
- **FR-002**: The selected view MUST persist across Dashboard visits within the same browser session via `sessionStorage` key `devteam.dashboard.view`. Source: US-001
- **FR-003**: The default view when no prior selection exists MUST be "List" (conservative — preserves existing behavior). Source: US-001
- **FR-004**: The toggle MUST be hidden when no features exist (the `EmptyState` component renders instead). Source: US-003
- **FR-005**: The `KanbanBoard` component MUST render exactly six phase columns in pipeline order: Inception, Planning, Construction, Review, Testing, Delivery — using `PHASES` and `PHASE_LABELS` from `ui/src/types`. Source: US-002
- **FR-006**: Each feature in the loaded `features` array MUST appear in exactly one column — the column whose phase equals `feature.current_phase`. Source: US-002
- **FR-007**: Features whose `current_phase` is not in `PHASES` MUST be placed in a trailing "Other" column rather than dropped. Source: US-002 (edge)
- **FR-008**: Each card on the board MUST display: title, priority badge (via `PRIORITY_LABELS`), status badge (via `STATUS_LABELS`), and pending-questions badge when `pending_questions_count > 0`. Source: US-002
- **FR-009**: Each card whose current-phase `gate_result` is present MUST display a passed/failed indicator matching the existing `FeatureCard` gate indicator. Source: US-002
- **FR-010**: Clicking a card on the board MUST navigate to `/features/:id` via `react-router`'s `Link` (same destination as the list view's `FeatureCard`). Source: US-002
- **FR-011**: Cards with `status` of `waiting_for_human` or `gate_blocked` MUST be visually flagged (distinct border/ring color) so they stand out at a glance. Source: US-002 (edge)
- **FR-012**: Empty columns MUST render with the column header and a muted "No features" placeholder in the body. Source: US-003
- **FR-013**: Each column body MUST scroll vertically independently when its content overflows; column headers and other columns MUST remain fixed. Source: US-004
- **FR-014**: The board's overall height MUST be bounded to the viewport so all six column headers remain visible without page-level scroll. Source: US-004
- **FR-015**: On viewports narrower than the board's natural width, the board container MUST scroll horizontally; each column has a minimum width of 240px. Source: US-004 (edge)
- **FR-016**: The board MUST consume the same `useQuery(['features'])` data as the list view — no new API call, no new endpoint, no backend change. Source: US-001, US-002
- **FR-017**: While the features query is loading, the board view MUST show the existing loading indicator (`features-loading` pattern); while the query is in an error state, it MUST show the existing error indicator (`features-error` pattern). Source: US-001

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **FeatureSummary** (existing, unchanged): `id`, `title`, `status`, `priority` (1|2|3), `current_phase` (one of `PHASES`), `updated_at`, `gate_result` (nullable), `pending_questions_count`. No new fields.
- **PhaseColumn** (UI-only, not persisted): derived from `PHASES`; carries `phase: PhaseName`, `features: FeatureSummary[]` (filtered from the query result). Lifecycle: ephemeral, recomputed on every render from the query data.

No data model changes. No new API endpoints. No backend changes.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A user can switch from List to Board view with a single click and see all features grouped into six phase columns within 1 render frame of the existing features query resolving.
- **SC-002**: Every feature returned by `GET /api/features` appears in exactly one column on the Board; zero features are dropped or duplicated.
- **SC-003**: The Board view adds zero new HTTP requests beyond the existing `GET /api/features` call already made by the Dashboard.
- **SC-004**: The Board view renders without console errors in Playwright (existing console-error assertion pattern extended to the Board view).
- **SC-005**: The existing list-view e2e tests (`app.spec.ts`) continue to pass unchanged — adding the Board is additive, no regression.
- **SC-006**: The Board view's first contentful paint completes within 200ms of the features query resolving (board rendering is pure CSS + React; no new data fetching).

## Assumptions

- [ASSUMPTION: View toggle default is "List" (conservative — preserves existing Dashboard behavior). Pending human answer Q-002; if the human picks Board-default, FR-003 changes.]
- [ASSUMPTION: The board and list share the same `/` Dashboard route — no new `/kanban` route. A single toggle control switches them. Pending human answer Q-003; if the human picks separate-route, FR-001 and the App.tsx routes change.]
- [ASSUMPTION: Columns are the six phases, not statuses. Status is shown as a badge on the card. Swimlane-per-status is out of scope (YAGNI — no UX evidence for it yet).]
- [ASSUMPTION: A feature appears in exactly one column — its `current_phase`. Multi-column membership is out of scope.]
- [ASSUMPTION: No separate "Backlog" column. Draft/unstarted features (status=draft, current_phase=inception) appear in the Inception column. Pending human answer Q-001; if the human picks Backlog, FR-005 and column count change to seven and a grouping rule for backlog is added.]
- [ASSUMPTION: Drag-and-drop is out of scope. The board is view-only. Phase transitions happen through the existing pipeline (`/advance`, `/recirculate`). Adding drag would require new backend endpoints and gate-aware drop rules — premature for a view feature. Pending human answer Q-005.]
- [ASSUMPTION: Click card → navigate to `/features/:id`, identical to the list view. A detail popover is out of scope; the detail page already exists and is the canonical view.]
- [ASSUMPTION: Card surfaces title, priority, status, pending-questions badge, and gate-result indicator. Last-updated timestamp is shown (matches existing card). Processing-mode is NOT surfaced — it's already on the detail page.]
- [ASSUMPTION: Column overflow = vertical scroll within each column, board height bounded to viewport. The "+N more" overflow pattern is out of scope — scroll is one CSS line, +N is a component. Pending human answer Q-007.]
- [ASSUMPTION: Empty columns render with header + muted "No features" placeholder. Hiding empty columns would obscure the pipeline shape — the whole point of the board is to show all six phases. Pending human answer Q-008.]
- [ASSUMPTION: Cancelled/done features remain on the board (not filtered out, not dimmed) — they're part of the retrospective view. Pending human answer Q-006; if the human picks dim/hide, FR-008/UI rules change.]
- [ASSUMPTION: View choice persists for the browser session only (sessionStorage). Cross-session persistence (localStorage) is out of scope — no user-preference backend exists. Pending human answer Q-004.]
- [ASSUMPTION: No new npm dependencies. Drag-and-drop is out of scope, so no dnd-kit/react-dnd. All layout via Tailwind utilities.]
- [ASSUMPTION: No backend changes. `GET /api/features` already returns every field the board needs.]
- [ASSUMPTION: This feature is UI-only and ships in the `devteam` repo's `ui/` directory. No secondary repos affected.]
- [ASSUMPTION: The Playwright e2e suite is the required test level for this feature (UI change). Unit tests for the column-grouping function are added where logic is non-trivial.]

## Constraint Register

No external standards, RFCs, or protocol conformance suites govern a UI Kanban view. The constraints are internal conventions:

| ID | Source | Section/Vector | Type | Constraint | Verification Method |
|----|--------|----------------|------|------------|---------------------|
| CON-001 | AGENTS.md | "Frontend (UI)" | consistency | UI changes are tested via `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright) on `:18765`, never `:8765` | E2E test runs against Playwright webServer config |
| CON-002 | AGENTS.md | "Project Structure" | consistency | New components live under `ui/src/components/`; new pages under `ui/src/pages/` | File-path check in plan/review |
| CON-003 | constitution.md | VIII "Go, Minimal Dependencies" | consistency | No new Python runtime dep; UI deps are permissible but should be minimal — prefer native/Tailwind over new libraries | package.json diff: no new runtime dep added |
| CON-004 | existing e2e | app.spec.ts | regression | Existing `feature-card-*` testids and `feature-count-badge` assertions continue to pass unchanged | `npm run test:e2e` green pre- and post-change |
| CON-005 | existing UI | types/index.ts | consistency | Board reuses `PHASES`, `PHASE_LABELS`, `STATUS_LABELS`, `PRIORITY_LABELS` — no duplicated phase/status strings | Grep: no new string literals for phase/status names in board component |
| CON-006 | FeatureCard.tsx | card chrome | consistency | Board card reuses the same badge color map and pending-questions badge as `FeatureCard` | Visual / class-name parity in review |
| CON-007 | Dashboard.tsx | data flow | consistency | Board consumes the same `useQuery(['features'])` result as the list — no second fetch | Network tab in e2e: exactly one `GET /api/features` |
| CON-008 | overconfidence-prevention | Pattern 2 | completeness | Empty-state, loading-state, and error-state paths explicitly covered (FR-017, US-3) | AC per state |
| CON-009 | overconfidence-prevention | Pattern 1 | completeness | Unknown `current_phase` handled defensively (FR-007) — no crash on enum drift | Unit test with synthetic unknown phase |

Every constraint has a corresponding acceptance criterion (see acceptance.md).

## Constitution Compliance

| Principle | Compliant | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| I. Spec-Driven, Always | ✅ | This spec is the contract. No implementation begins until spec.md + acceptance.md + repos.yaml exist and the inception gate passes. |
| II. Six Roles, Fixed Pipeline | ✅ | This spec is the PM's inception output. It does not dictate architecture (Architect), code (Developer), or tests (Tester) beyond constraints. |
| III. Central Spec, Distributed Implementation | ✅ | Single spec in the `devteam` repo. `repos.yaml` declares scope — primary repo only, no secondary repos. |
| IV. Two Intake Paths, One Output Format | ✅ | Loose-idea intake; produces the standard spec.md + acceptance.md + repos.yaml shape. |
| V. Proof-of-Work Gates | ✅ | Acceptance criteria are Given/When/Then with explicit test levels and verification methods. No "should work well". |
| VI. Cross-Repo Coherence | ✅ | Single-repo feature. N/A. |
| VII. Self-Bootstrap | ✅ | The platform builds itself; this feature improves the platform's own UI. |
| VIII. Go, Minimal Dependencies | ✅ | No backend changes. UI adds no new runtime npm dependency — pure Tailwind + existing React/react-query/react-router. |
| IX. Pipeline Governance | ✅ | Security and resiliency extensions evaluated — this is a view-only UI feature with no auth, no external calls, no state mutations; the extensions' mandatory checks are N/A and documented as such. |
| X. Learn From Cistern | ✅ | Structured context (this spec) beats freeform. Phase gate will be mechanically enforced. |

### Extension applicability

- **security**: N/A. View-only UI. No new endpoint, no input handling, no auth surface, no data mutation. The board reads already-authenticated API responses.
- **resiliency**: N/A. No new external calls. The board reuses the existing `useQuery(['features'])` which already has react-query's retry/error handling. Loading and error states are explicitly covered (FR-017) by reusing existing Dashboard patterns.
- **error-recovery**: Applied. Ambiguous requirements resolved via questions.json; conservative defaults documented as `[ASSUMPTION:]`.
- **overconfidence-prevention**: Applied. Empty state (US-3), error state (FR-017), unknown-enum edge (FR-007), and defensive missing-`total_count` handling all explicitly covered.
